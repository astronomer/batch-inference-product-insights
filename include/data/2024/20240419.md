What do you like best about Astro by Astronomer?
I like that it is flexible, well documented, has good support. Its UI is pleasing too. It's fast, allows to schedule lots differents jobs by nature (data engineering, ML models, MLOps, etc). It's overall a fantastic orchestration service.

What do you dislike about Astro by Astronomer?
I wish it was easier to see duration of each task over the recent runs.

I also wish we didn't have to have all our ETLs in one github repository as it makes going from dev to prod messy at times.

I would love to see even more training for new people. As an experienced user it clearly has a high learning curve and find myself having to explain stuff a lot to people!

Quite a lot of breaking changes with google dependencies especially - can be quite time consuming to just maintain the instances running despite no changes to code.
