"Astronomer Powered Airflow"
What do you like best about Astro by Astronomer?
Ease of setting up and launching Airflow in production. Suits well for teams which have limited data engineering capacity and allows to focus more on the business logic for the pipelines.

What do you dislike about Astro by Astronomer?
Have been using the product for 3 months now. I do not see any limitations per se with the Astro itself. It used to have very limited functionality for integrating dbt projects but with the latest release, this concern is addressed.
