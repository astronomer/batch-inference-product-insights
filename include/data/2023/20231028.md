"Best product for a startup"
What do you like best about Astro by Astronomer?
When working at a startup with limited resources, we don't have time to worry about self-managing Airflow. Astronomer enabled us to get started with Airflow very quickly without the hassel of setting it up ourselves or worrying about as much maintenance. The customer support is amazing. The field engineer assigned to us is very smart and proactive to make sure all of our requirements are met.

What do you dislike about Astro by Astronomer?
Nothing to dislike. I've worked at companies where we self-hosted Airflow which was such a hassel. Astronomer makes everything so much easier.
