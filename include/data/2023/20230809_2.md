"Using Astronomer for 12 months in a data engineering team"
What do you like best about Astro by Astronomer?
The fact that it is a SaaS lets our team focus on the coding side; it is quite simple to start using Airflow as you can skip all the initial setups. This is particularly useful for those teams that started using Python and are more distant from the infra side (i.e. data Scientists, analysts, etc.).

What do you dislike about Astro by Astronomer?
I feel that the monitoring dashboard is not rich enough in all circumstances so that we can fully understand possible issues there. For instance, there is no option for accessing KubernetesPod settings alongside our cloud account.
