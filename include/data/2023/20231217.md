"Stable Platform with good service"
What do you like best about Astro by Astronomer?
I like the fact that they have come a long way from being a startup supporting opensource airflow to becoming an enterprise focusing on what their customers want. They have a history of feature rich development to provide best cutomer support. Their dev and production enviornment deployment via CI/CD provide an ease of implementation and integration of Airflow for their customers. I find the system easy to use that gives me confidence. They had their ups and downs as an orgination but they have come a long way from there. I am happy to say Fanduel 's decion to use Astronomer has proven to be a good success.
