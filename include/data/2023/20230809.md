What do you dislike about Astro by Astronomer?
While Astronomer is a game-changer, there's room for growth. New users might face a slight learning curve despite the user-friendly interface. Expanding the range of pre-built operators would add flexibility. Although the documentation is decent, more detailed guides, especially for advanced features, would be a welcome addition. Overall, refinement in these areas would enhance the experience even more.
